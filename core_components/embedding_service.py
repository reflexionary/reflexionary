Tacit - Embedding Service

This module provides a high-level interface for generating dense vector embeddings from text
using pre-trained transformer models. It implements a singleton pattern to ensure efficient
model loading and memory usage across the application.

Key Features:
- Global model loading for efficient resource utilization
- Thread-safe embedding generation
- Built-in semantic similarity testing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

    Converts a given text string into its numerical vector embedding.

    This function utilizes the globally loaded pre-trained Transformer neural network
    to transform human-readable text into a high-dimensional numerical representation.
    The resulting vector semantically encodes the meaning of the input text,
    where texts with similar meanings will correspond to numerically 'close' embeddings
    in the vector space.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text string to be embedded. It should be clean and relevant.

        List[float]: A list of floating-point numbers representing the vector embedding of the text.
                     The length of this list is determined by `EMBEDDING_DIM`.
