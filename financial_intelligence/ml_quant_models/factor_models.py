Bayesian Factor Models for Quantitative Finance

This module implements advanced Bayesian factor models for analyzing portfolio exposures
to various market factors. It provides a conceptual framework for understanding how
portfolios are exposed to different risk factors like value, momentum, size, etc.

Note: This is a conceptual implementation. A production implementation would use
libraries like TensorFlow Probability or PyMC3 for full Bayesian inference.

    (Conceptual) Calculates portfolio exposure to various market factors using Bayesian models.
    Relates to TFP (TensorFlow Probability) and advanced factor models.

    In a real implementation, this would use Bayesian methods to estimate factor exposures
    while accounting for uncertainty in the estimates. It would be particularly useful for:
    - Handling limited historical data
    - Incorporating prior beliefs about factor relationships
    - Providing uncertainty estimates for exposures

    Args:
        user_id (str): The unique identifier for the user.
        portfolio_id (str): Identifier for the portfolio (e.g., 'current', 'optimized').

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing:
            - user_id: The input user ID
            - portfolio_id: The input portfolio ID
            - factor_exposures: Dictionary mapping factor names to exposure values
