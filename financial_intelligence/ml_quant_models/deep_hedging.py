Deep Hedging with Reinforcement Learning

This module implements conceptual deep hedging strategies for options portfolios using
Reinforcement Learning techniques. It's inspired by cutting-edge research in the field
of AI for quantitative finance, particularly work from Google DeepMind Finance Research.

Deep hedging involves training RL agents to dynamically manage hedging portfolios
in complex, non-linear market environments, going beyond traditional static strategies.
